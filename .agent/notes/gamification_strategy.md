# Gamification Strategy for Secure Coding

- **Concept**: Use gamified scenarios to discover and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Approach**: Create "mini-games" or interactive scenarios where the student acts as both a "hacker" (discovery) and a "developer" (fix).
- **Goal**: Increase engagement and retention of secure coding principles.
- **Applied to**: Guideline 3-2 (SQL Injection) via "The High Score Heist" exercise.
