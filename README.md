# Java secure coding

To minimize the likelihood of security vulnerabilities caused by programmer error, Java developers should adhere to recommended coding rules available at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html. 

This repo contains labs, PoCs, experiments and exploits, related to the topics listed in Oracle's Java coding guidelines. 


- [Lab 1-2](labs/1-2/README.md) / DOS-2: Release resources in all cases
- [Lab 8-3](labs/8-3/README.md) / SERIAL-3: View deserialization the same as object construction
